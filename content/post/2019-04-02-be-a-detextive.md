Self-handicapping can be quite productive on those non-urgent things. 
Recently, I noticed a LaTeX template, 
[Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV), so I was thinking trying 
it to replace [Modern CV](https://launchpad.net/moderncv), which has 
accompanied me for around three years.

I soon realized that I am pretty bad at LaTeX, while customization requires 
certain level of fluency on that language, so here comes my struggling with it.

## Support for a publication list

Awesome CV has a louder design than Modern CV. It caught my attention but at 
the same time makes it harder to add content that was beyond its original 
design and make it fit. The vanilla version looks quite software engineering 
oriented and publication list seems not to be a major concern.

Nonetheless, people like me who tie their lives with publications have nothing 
to worry about, because in the amazing and vast open source community, there is 
almost always someone who is way better than you who sufferred and fixed your 
issue years ago. Indeed, I soon find 
[a fork](https://github.com/aminmkhan/Awesome-CV) that formats publications 
beautifully.

## Compiling the examples with `tinytex`

I clone the repository, and start to have some fun with it. I used `tinytex` 
and stay in my comfort zone with R. Though 
`tinytex::xelatex("cv.tex", bib_engine = "biber")` failed due to some issue 
with FontAwesome, `lualatex("cv.tex", bib_engine = "biber")` succeeded in 
giving a pdf after a few tweaks:

- In awesome-cv.cls: [`\newfontfamily\FA[Path=\@fontdir]{FontAwesome}`](https://github.com/chenyenchung/Awesome-CV/blob/0db3500198eb362410e8fa56826134ad769e896f/awesome-cv.cls#L164) needs 
to be edited to `\setfontfamily\FA[Path=\@fontdir]{FontAwesome}`, because `\FA` 
is already defined in `fontawesome.sty`.

- `biblatex` complained that `Package biblatex Warning: 'sorting' option to ` 
`'\printbibliography' is no longer supported.`, so those were removed from 
`publications.tex`

Though there was a good looking PDF waiting for me after this, a warning 
message refused to go away after several re-run:
```
Warning message:
LaTeX Warning: There were undefined references.
Package biblatex Warning: Please rerun LaTeX.
(biblatex)                Page breaks have changed. 
```

## Different behavior in `tinytex` and `latexmk`

According to the documentation, `lualatex()` is a wrapper for `latexmk()`, 
which emulates the command `latexmk` in command line, so I tried to use 
`latexmk` directly to see if my LaTeX environment was alright. Suprisingly, 
`latexmk -lualatex cv.tex` ran sucessfully without warning, and even weirder 
things happened: when I ran `lualatex("cv.tex", bib_engine = "biber")` again, 
even in R, there was no longer warning.

I checked the directory to find the cause of the difference. `latexmk` left 
several auxillary file in the folder (`cv.aux`, `cv.bbl`, `cv.bcf`, `cv.blg`, 
`cv.fls`, `cv.fdb_latexmk`, `cv.out`, and `cv.run.xml`). Guessing one of them 
might prevent `tinytex::lualatex()` from triggering the warning, I removed 
these files one by one and run `tinytex::lualatex()` to see if the warning 
comes back (All hail reverse genetics!)

Indeed, if `cv.bbl` was in the folder, both `latexmk` and `tinytex::lualatex()` 
ran smoothly, but if `cv.bbl` was renamed or removed, `tinytex::lualatex()` 
began to give warning again.

I wondered what is the difference between `tinytex` generated `.bbl` and the 
one generated by `latexmk`, so I tried 
`lualatex("cv.tex", bib_engine = "biber", clean = FALSE)` to keep the auxillary 
files. Surprisingly, `diff` said the two `.bbl` files were exactly the same, 
and keeping the `.bbl` generated by 
`lualatex("cv.tex", bib_engine = "biber", clean = FALSE)` also prevented the 
warning.

## Conclusion
It seemed that sometimes LaTeX needs to run more than 4 times (the `lualatex` - 
`biber` - `lualatex` - `lualatex` run by `latexmk` or `tinytex`) to make sure 
`bibtex` is working properly, and the error message is in fact precise. Because 
`tinytex::lualatex()` is being very considerate to remove all the intermediate 
files, the suggestion from the warning, `Please rerun LaTeX`, is not effective 
because everything is cleaned, so every run is like the first run.

I still don't know why does `bibtex` need `.bbl` file and why pagebreak 
mysteriously changed in the example file, but it was quite fun.

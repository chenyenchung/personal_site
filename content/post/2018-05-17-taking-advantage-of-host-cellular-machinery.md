This is a story about how poxvirus turns human translation machinery in
favor of viral transcript by modifying a ribosome-associated gene,
*RACK1*. With the phosphorylation of RACK1, human ribosomes become fond
of the uncapped transcripts with poly-adenylation in its 5' untranslated
region from poxvirus.

This might not look like the most intriguing story, and I did not think
so either. Nevertheless, when I read the story incidentally, there are
quite a few things that catch my interest.

Jha et al. found RACK1 promotes viral protein synthesis by comparing
RACK1 knock-out cell to wild type, but they failed to over-express
RACK1, and knocking down RACK1 failed repeat the observation despite
decreased expression of RACK1. When I read this part, I longed for the
motivation that kept the authors moving on. If I were in their shoes, I
might get so haunted by the thought that it was some subtle technical
errors preventing adequate over-expression or knock-down, and I would
not discover how strictly the protein level of RACK1 is regulated that
over-expression causes the degradation of both exogenous and endogenous
RACK1 so the total amount remain the same, or how poxvirus only utilized
a minor fraction of RACK1, so there was still enough after knocking it
down.

The authors applied an uncommon montage here. Instead of explaining each
transition so the story looks like an expedition, they chose to
demonstrate the results one by one, and rationales, if present, were
kept minimal and described with interpretation.

They started from how RACK1 could be post-translationally modified and
then directly introduced PKCßII, a human gene played an important role
in RACK1 phosphorylation, while emphasizing this phosphorylation is only
seen in infected cells but never occurs in normal condition, which
implicitly indicates it could not be the normal function of PKCßII to
catalyze this phosphorylation on RACK1.

This montage is present through the article, creating a riddle-solving
atmosphere.

The localization of RACK1 to “viral factory” was shown first and then
the introduction to what viral factory is and their interpretation of
the phenomena came together at the end of the paragraph.

It seems to be known that CAA repeat in the 5' UTR of tobacco mosaic
viral RNA is key to the preference of plant ribosome to viral
transcripts, but the analogy of the poly-adenylated 5' UTR of poxviral
transcript to the CAA repeat-containing tobacco mosaic viral transcripts
was only mentioned in the end.

Retrospectively speaking, it might be a good way to improve perceived
impact — what the authors reported was a novel phenomenon, which is not
intuitively linked to the strategy tobacco mosaic virus has been using.
Perhaps this is an advanced writing style that I am not familiar with.
After all, the montage creates an impression that *the authors
characterized a novel strategy and then found out this strategy is
widely implemented in across kingdoms,* while avoiding a narrative
opening with “the strategy we find in poxvirus is reminiscent of a
clever thing tobacco mosaic virus does”, which is an unfavorable
alternative because it tastes like that the authors described yet
another viral species that use a well-known strategy.

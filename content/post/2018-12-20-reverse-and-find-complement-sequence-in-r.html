<p>Recently, I am continuously being amazed by how a seemingly <em>simple</em>
task is actually implemented in a sophisticated way. I guess I am just
taking so many things for granted just because it was implemented and
refined to an extent that I don’t even feel it.</p>
<p>When someone asked me “how do you reverse and then find the complement
sequence of some DNA?” I googled and found a couple of functions, and
then I decided to challenge myself to re-invent this wheel.</p>
<p>My goal in this post is to build is a function that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Reverse the sequence</li>
<li>Convert base by base: ATCG to TAGC for DNA; AUGC to
UACG for RNA</li>
</ol>
<p>Since R treats the <code>character</code> type as a whole and does not provide an
explicit way to reverse it, I start from building one function that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Split a multi-charactered string into a vector of
alphabets</li>
<li>Reverse it with <code>rev()</code></li>
</ol>
<pre><code>seq_rev &lt;- function(char) {
  alphabets &lt;- strsplit(char, split = &quot;&quot;)[[1]]
  return(rev(alphabets))
}</code></pre>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Find complementary nucleotides.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>seq_compl &lt;- function(seq) {
  # Check if there&#39;s &quot;T&quot; in the sequence
  RNA &lt;- Reduce(`|`, seq == &quot;U&quot;)
  cmplvec &lt;- sapply(seq, function(base) {
    # This makes DNA the default
    # As long as there&#39;s no U, the sequence is treated as DNA
    if (RNA) {
      switch(base, &quot;A&quot; = &quot;U&quot;, &quot;C&quot; = &quot;G&quot;, &quot;G&quot; = &quot;C&quot;, &quot;U&quot; = &quot;A&quot;)
    } else {
      switch(base, &quot;A&quot; = &quot;T&quot;, &quot;C&quot; = &quot;G&quot;, &quot;G&quot; = &quot;C&quot;, &quot;T&quot; = &quot;A&quot;)
    }
  })
  return(paste(cmplvec, collapse = &quot;&quot;))
}</code></pre>
<p>Since I want to accommodate both DNA and RNA, one extra thing I did here
was to distinguish them by the presence of uridine (“U”) in the
sequence, which is specific to RNA.</p>
<p>Now, I have functions for reversal and complementation. Let’s test if it
works .</p>
<pre><code>seq_compl(seq_rev(&quot;CCAAT&quot;))
&gt; seq_compl(seq_rev(&quot;CCAAT&quot;))
[1] &quot;ATTGG&quot;</code></pre>
<p>It looks okay, but it’s in fact failure prone. You might notice that my
script assumed the sequences to be in upper case, which might not always
be true. Additionally, if anything other than the bases, like a number
or “X”, is passed to the functions, the functions do not know how to
handle them.</p>
<p>So, I’ll write a function that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Wrap the two naive functions from above.</li>
<li>Handle the issues that are foreseeable.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>revcom &lt;- function(input) {
  # Make sure the input is character and in upper case
  input &lt;- as.character(input)
  input &lt;- toupper(input)

  # Use regular expression to check if there&#39;s only legal bases
  # present in the sequence
  legal_char &lt;- Reduce(`&amp;`, grepl(&quot;^[A,T,C,G,U]*$&quot;, input))

  if (!legal_char) {
    stop(&quot;revcom() only applies to DNA/RNA sequences, and only A/T/C/G/U is allowed&quot;)
  }

  rev &lt;- seq_rev(input)
  return(seq_compl(rev))
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>revcom()</code> works like this now:</p>
<pre><code># The function seems to work
&gt; revcom(&quot;ATTTCAT&quot;)
[1] &quot;ATGAAAT&quot;

# It handles illegal characters and provides an error
&gt; revcom(&quot;ATTTCATX&quot;)
Error in revcom(&quot;ATTTCATX&quot;) : 
  revcom() only applies to DNA/RNA sequences, and only A/T/C/G/U is allowed

# Non-character input is converted to character and then judged
# whether they are legit
&gt; revcom(1)
Error in revcom(1) : 
  revcom() only applies to DNA/RNA sequences, and only A/T/C/G/U is allowed</code></pre>
<p>Ok, I’ve made my “wheel”. It’s time to see if the wheel rolls <em>well</em>.
Considering how long genomic sequences can be, I chose running speed as
the benchmark here.</p>
<pre><code># Generate a 100 kb random DNA sequence
testseq &lt;- paste(sample(x = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;G&quot;), replace = TRUE, size = 1e5),
                 collapse = &quot;&quot;)

# Preallocate a vector to save the running time for each repeat
elapsedtime &lt;- vector()

# Find reverse-complement sequence for 10 times
for (i in seq(10)) {
  start &lt;- Sys.time()
  invisible(revcom(testseq))
  end &lt;- Sys.time()
  elapsedtime[i] &lt;- end - start
}</code></pre>
<pre><code># Print the averge time spent
print(mean(elapsedtime))

[1] 0.1781383</code></pre>
<p>Though the way I look for legal bases and that <code>grepl()</code> I used to check
if a sequence is RNA posed extra computation on the function, a hundred
thousand bases in 0.18 seconds feels reasonably fast. Converting several
sequences with their length ranging between 1 kilo bases to 1 mega bases
shows the time required for conversion increases linearly with sequence
length. It seems to make sense, since I every base is examined and
converted independently, so no extra work should be introduced with a
longer length.</p>

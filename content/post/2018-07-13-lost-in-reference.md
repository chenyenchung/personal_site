I have an evergrowing pile of unread but interesting paper in my
download folder. With the size growing from several hundred MB to more
than 2 GB, it is becoming hard to find a pdf file when I really need it.

Back in 2015, I was annoyed and decided to look seriously for some tools
that would manage the mess. I was looking for something which could
retrieve metadata when importing pdf and searches fast in the database
when I provide only a couple of keywords and then name of corresponding
author (“I need the *Jessell* paper on *digits*”). Mendeley seemed fine
for these purposes then, so I spent some time and organized my files
under it.

One month later, I noticed the mobile app of Mendeley stopped working
after an update. Specifically, it kept logging itself out. I did not
worry too much because I spent most of my time in front of my laptop,
but I was surprised it took a couple of days for the support team to
reply “Please be patient, we are working on that” in the official forum
and then another 2 weeks to release a fix.

Having said so, Mendeley served me quite well after that, so I started
to forget the mobile app event and to recommend it to my colleagues.

Then, it broke badly again in early June 2018. After an update of its
desktop app, it refused to open any pdf and wrongly complained those
files were corrupted. I checked Twitter and was surprised again that the
bug was reported and seemed to be epidemic in late May, but the buggy
update was still online. People were complaining missing highlight and
messed-up references in their Word file, and in the end, *it took them
almost one month to fix this one*.

With two events of slow response to bugs that affect the majority of
their users, the technical support for something backed by a publishing
tycoon seems to be too weak, and because of its instability,
synchronization of files and highlights started to look more like a
disadvantage than an edge. After all, synchronized files and highlights
would be gone when service is down.

So, I am back on my search of tools recently, and here’s my brief
opinion:

  - Pdf rendering in ReadCube is still slow on my
    laptop. Though other functions are fine, a pdf reader preventing
    browsing is a deal breaker to me.
  - Metadata retrieval becomes much better in Zotero
    that it was in 2014, and it uses default pdf reader which usually
    works fine. Since my need for reading on mobile device is not high,
    synchronization with Dropbox might suffice.
  - F1000Workspace has an amazing web clipper and
    highlighter, but the display of highlight on their online pdf reader
    is far from acceptable, with highlighting overlapping with each
    other in a sentence. Its storage is completely online, so it might
    alleviate my shortage in disk space.
  - The interface of Papers 3 is still as slow as I
    tried it 3 years ago, but the pdf reader works just fine.
  - Mendeley is generally fine if it does not break.
    When it breaks, it’s serious and takes long to be fixed.
  - The built-in search in MacOS does a good job in
    searching the text inside pdf, so perhaps no reference manager would
    also be an option.

Yen-Chung Chen is a PhD student in the Desplan lab at New York University. My 
research interests include how neuronal fate is specified into different 
subtypes and how cell fate leads to the establishment and maintenance of 
distinct features like precise selection of synaptic partners, the use of 
neurotransmitters, and unique firing patterns.

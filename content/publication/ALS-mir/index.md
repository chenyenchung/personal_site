# Abstract.
abstract = "Progressive degeneration of motor neurons (MNs) is the hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Limb-innervating lateral motor column MNs (LMC-MNs) seem to be particularly vulnerable and are among the first MNs affected in ALS. Here, we report association of this differential susceptibility with reduced expression of the _mir-17∼92_ cluster in LMC-MNs prior to disease onset. Reduced _mir-17∼92_ is accompanied by elevated nuclear PTEN in spinal MNs of presymptomatic SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. Selective dysregulation of the _mir-17∼92_/nuclear PTEN axis in degenerating SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> LMC-MNs was confirmed in a double-transgenic embryonic stem cell system and recapitulated in human SOD1 +/L144F-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived MNs. We further show that overexpression of _mir-17∼92_ significantly rescues human SOD1 <sup>+/L144F</sup> MNs, and intrathecal delivery of adeno-associated virus (AAV)9- _mir-17∼92_ improves motor deficits and survival in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. Thus, mir-17∼92 may have value as a prognostic marker of MN degeneration and is a candidate therapeutic target in SOD1-linked ALS."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary = "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive paralysis that is lethal and incurable to date. In this article, we discovered a developmentally critical microRNA cluster, _mir-17~92_, plays a role in the vulnerability of spinal motor neurons and supplementing this microRNA cluster can prolong the life expectancy in a mouse disease model."

abstract = {The mammalian imprinted \textit{Dlk1-Dio3} locus produces multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from the maternally inherited allele, including \textit{Meg3} (i.e., \textit{Gtl2}) in the mammalian genome. Although this locus has well-characterized functions in stem cell and tumor contexts, its role during neural development is unknown. By profiling cell types at each stage of embryonic stem cell-derived motor neurons (ESC\textasciitildeMNs) that recapitulate spinal cord development, we uncovered that lncRNAs expressed from the \textit{Dlk1-Dio3} locus are predominantly and gradually enriched in rostral motor neurons (MNs). Mechanistically, \textit{Meg3} and other \textit{Dlk1-Dio3} locus-derived lncRNAs facilitate Ezh2/Jarid2 interactions. Loss of these lncRNAs compromises the H3K27me3 landscape, leading to aberrant expression of progenitor and caudal \textit{Hox} genes in postmitotic MNs. Our data thus illustrate that these lncRNAs in the \textit{Dlk1-Dio3} locus, particularly \textit{Meg3}, play a critical role in maintaining postmitotic MN cell fate by repressing progenitor genes and they shape MN subtype identity by regulating \textit{Hox} genes.},

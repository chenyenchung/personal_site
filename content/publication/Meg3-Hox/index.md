# Abstract.
abstract = "The mammalian imprinted _Dlk1-Dio3_ locus produces multiple long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) from the maternally inherited allele, including _Meg3_ (i.e., _Gtl2_) in the mammalian genome. Although this locus has well-characterized functions in stem cell and tumor contexts, its role during neural development is unknown. By profiling cell types at each stage of embryonic stem cell-derived motor neurons (ESC~MNs) that recapitulate spinal cord development, we uncovered that lncRNAs expressed from the _Dlk1-Dio3_ locus are predominantly and gradually enriched in rostral motor neurons (MNs). Mechanistically, _Meg3_ and other _Dlk1-Dio3_ locus-derived lncRNAs facilitate Ezh2/Jarid2 interactions. Loss of these lncRNAs compromises the H3K27me3 landscape, leading to aberrant expression of progenitor and caudal _Hox_ genes in postmitotic MNs. Our data thus illustrate that these lncRNAs in the _Dlk1-Dio3_ locus, particularly _Meg3_, play a critical role in maintaining postmitotic MN cell fate by repressing progenitor genes and they shape MN subtype identity by regulating _Hox_ genes."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary = "In this article, we demonstrated that a long non-coding RNA, _Meg3_, is required to establish the boundary between two genes that mark spinal motor neurons from different body segments. To suppress the expression of caudal genes from expressing in rostral segments, _Meg3_ forms a complex with PRC2 to suppress them, the catalytic complex that marks histone with repressive modificication H3K27me3."

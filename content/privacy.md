## Who I am?

I am Yen-Chung Chen, and this is my personal website (https://www.yccbio.net/). I am not an expert in website technology nor in privacy law, so the following description is to the best of my understanding of how this website is built and my intentions. If you suspect your privacy is compromised while browsing, please don't hesitate to [contact me](mailto:ycc520@nyu.edu).

The website is written with [blogdown](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blogdown/index.html), the source is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/chenyenchung/personal_site), and generated by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).


## Collection of your personal information

The website does not identify you. To understand website traffic, I may use third-party services like Google Analytics. In order to learn website traffic, Google puts a cookie with a random ID to collect anonymized information, including but not limited to browser type, region, language, entry link, and the duration of each page viewed. I only have access to aggregated and anonymous report (You can learn more about [Google Analytics' privacy policy](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245) here.)

Most browsers allow you to disable the use of cookies completely, and this website will work exactly the same to you. If you would like to access what browsing information I have - or ask me to delete any Google Analytics data - please check your \_ga cookies and [reach out to me](mailto:ycc520@nyu.edu) with your clientID ([detailed instruction](https://adzerk.com/blog/gdpr-google-analytics/)), and/or install the [Google Analytics Opt-Out Browser Add-On](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

## Sharing of your personal information

The anonymized information collected will be in the form of an aggregated report and will be only for my personal use.

## Use of your personal information

The browsing information Google Analytics collects is presented to me as aggregated reports for the purpose of understanding visitor traffic and trends.
